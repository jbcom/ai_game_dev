Welcome to 2089's most advanced educational simulation. You are a Data Architect 
navigating the three-dimensional space of NeoTokyo's Central AI Neural Network. 
After completing your training at Code Academy and mastering retro rendering 
techniques, you're ready for the final challenge: true 3D programming.

Navigate through neurons represented as interconnected 3D nodes, manipulate 
synaptic connections using physics-based interactions, and debug corrupted 
neural pathways. Each sector of the network teaches advanced 3D concepts: 
mesh manipulation, shader programming, particle systems, physics simulation, 
and procedural generation. Your Professor Pixel AI companion now exists as 
a full 3D hologram, guiding you through this complex digital mindscape.

# Getting Started with AI Game Development

## Quick Start

The AI Game Development ecosystem provides revolutionary tools for creating games with artificial intelligence. Choose your preferred game engine and get started in minutes.

### Installation

#### Core Packages (Python)
```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install ai-game-dev ai-game-assets

# Or install from workspace
uv sync
```

#### Engine-Specific Packages

**Pygame (2D Games)**
```bash
pip install pygame-ai-game-dev pygame
```

**Arcade (Educational/Web Games)**
```bash
pip install arcade-ai-game-dev arcade
```

**Bevy (Rust/High Performance)**
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
bevy-ai-game-dev = "1.0"
bevy = "0.14"
```

**Godot (GDScript Plugin)**
Download from Godot Asset Library: "AI Game Development Generator"

### Your First AI-Generated Game

#### Python Example (Pygame)
```python
from pygame_game_dev import generate_pygame_project, GameSpec, GameType, ComplexityLevel

# Define what you want to create
spec = GameSpec(
    name="Space Adventure",
    description="A retro space shooter with power-ups",
    game_type=GameType.TWO_DIMENSIONAL,
    features=["player movement", "enemies", "shooting", "power-ups"],
    complexity=ComplexityLevel.BEGINNER
)

# Generate complete game project
project = generate_pygame_project(spec)

# Your game is ready! The project contains:
# - main.py (entry point)
# - game.py (game logic)
# - player.py (player system)
# - constants.py (game settings)
```

#### Rust Example (Bevy)
```rust
use bevy_game_dev::{AIGameDev, GameSpec, GameType, ComplexityLevel};

fn main() {
    let spec = GameSpec {
        name: "Tower Defense".to_string(),
        description: "Strategic tower defense with AI enemies".to_string(),
        game_type: GameType::TwoDimensional,
        features: vec!["towers".to_string(), "enemies".to_string(), "strategy".to_string()],
        complexity: ComplexityLevel::Intermediate,
    };
    
    let mut game_dev = AIGameDev::new();
    let project = game_dev.generate_bevy_project(&spec).unwrap();
    
    // Complete Bevy game with ECS components and systems generated
}
```

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Generation
- **Intelligent Code Creation**: Generate complete game projects from natural language descriptions
- **Asset Generation**: Create images, sounds, and music with AI
- **Adaptive Content**: Games that evolve based on player behavior

### Multi-Engine Support
- **Pygame**: Perfect for learning and prototyping
- **Arcade**: Educational games and web deployment
- **Bevy**: High-performance Rust games
- **Godot**: Full-featured 3D/2D game engine
- **Unity**: Professional game development (coming soon)

### Production Ready
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, maintainable code
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms and caching
- **Cross-Platform**: Deploy anywhere
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Asset Generation
```python
from ai_game_assets import AssetGenerator

asset_gen = AssetGenerator()

# Generate game assets
character_sprite = asset_gen.generate_image(
    "Pixel art warrior character with sword and shield",
    style="pixel_art",
    resolution="256x256"
)

battle_music = asset_gen.generate_audio(
    "Epic orchestral battle music with drums",
    duration=120,
    style="orchestral"
)
```

### Workflow Integration
```python
from ai_game_dev import WorkflowGenerator

# Generate complete development workflow
workflow = WorkflowGenerator.from_description(
    "Create a multiplayer battle royale game with procedural maps"
)

# Execute automated development pipeline
workflow.execute()
```

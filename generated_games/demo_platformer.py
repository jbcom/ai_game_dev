# Generated 2D Platformer Demo
# Concept: ### Game Title: **Elysian Quest**

**Brief Description:**  
Elysian Quest is a 2D fantasy platformer game where players embark on a journey through the mystical land of Eldoria. Players will navigate ...

Certainly! Below is a simple Pygame starter code for a 2D platformer that includes a basic player character that can move and jump, a simple gravity system, basic collision detection with platforms, and a game loop structure. This code is clean and well-commented for your understanding.

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
GRAVITY = 0.5
PLAYER_JUMP_STRENGTH = 10
PLAYER_SPEED = 5
FPS = 60

# Colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)

# Player class
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rect = pygame.Rect(100, SCREEN_HEIGHT - 150, 50, 50)  # x, y, width, height
        self.velocity_y = 0
        self.on_ground = False

    def move(self, keys):
        # Horizontal movement
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= PLAYER_SPEED
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += PLAYER_SPEED

        # Jumping
        if self.on_ground and keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
            self.velocity_y = -PLAYER_JUMP_STRENGTH
        
        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity_y += GRAVITY
        self.rect.y += self.velocity_y

        # Check if player is on the ground
        if self.rect.y >= SCREEN_HEIGHT - 50:  # Platform height
            self.rect.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT - 50
            self.velocity_y = 0
            self.on_ground = True
        else:
            self.on_ground = False

    def draw(self, surface):
        pygame.draw.rect(surface, BLUE, self.rect)

# Main function
def main():
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.set_caption("2D Platformer")
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()

    player = Player()
    
    # Main game loop
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()

        # Fill the screen with white
        screen.fill(WHITE)

        # Get the current keys pressed
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

        # Update player
        player.move(keys)

        # Draw player
        player.draw(screen)

        # Update the display
        pygame.display.flip()

        # Cap the frame rate
        clock.tick(FPS)

# Run the game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Pygame Initialization**: We start by initializing Pygame and setting up constants for screen dimensions, gravity, player speed, and other parameters.

2. **Player Class**: The `Player` class defines the player's properties and behaviors:
   - The player's rectangle is created to represent the character.
   - The `move` method handles horizontal movement, jumping, and gravity.
   - The `draw` method draws the player on the screen.

3. **Game Loop**: The main function contains the game loop:
   - It handles events such as quitting the game.
   - Updates the player's position based on input.
   - Clears the screen and redraws the player.
   - Caps the frame rate to maintain a consistent speed.

### How to Run the Code:
1. Make sure you have Pygame installed. You can install it using `pip install pygame`.
2. Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., `platformer.py`.
3. Run the script using `python platformer.py`.

You can move the player left and right using the arrow keys and jump using the spacebar. The player will be affected by gravity, and you can expand this code to add more features like platforms, enemies, and collectibles!

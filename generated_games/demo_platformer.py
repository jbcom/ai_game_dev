# Generated 2D Platformer Demo
# Concept: ### Game Title: **Elysian Echoes**

#### Brief Description:
Elysian Echoes is a vibrant 2D fantasy platformer that immerses players in a lush, magical world where nature and ancient spirits intertwine...

Here's a simple Pygame starter code for a 2D platformer with basic player movement, jumping, a gravity system, and collision detection. This code sets up the game loop, initializes the game, and includes comments to help you understand each part of the code.

```python
import pygame
import sys

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60
GRAVITY = 0.5
JUMP_STRENGTH = 10

# Colors
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)

# Player class
class Player:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 100
        self.y = 500
        self.width = 50
        self.height = 50
        self.color = BLUE
        self.velocity_y = 0
        self.on_ground = False

    def move(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.x -= 5
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.x += 5
        if keys[pygame.K_SPACE] and self.on_ground:
            self.velocity_y = -JUMP_STRENGTH
            self.on_ground = False

        # Apply gravity
        self.velocity_y += GRAVITY
        self.y += self.velocity_y

        # Check for ground collision
        if self.y >= SCREEN_HEIGHT - self.height:
            self.y = SCREEN_HEIGHT - self.height
            self.velocity_y = 0
            self.on_ground = True

    def draw(self, screen):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, self.color, (self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height))

# Platform class
class Platform:
    def __init__(self, x, y, width, height):
        self.rect = pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height)

    def draw(self, screen):
        pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, self.rect)

# Main game function
def main():
    # Set up the display
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Simple 2D Platformer")

    # Create player and platforms
    player = Player()
    platforms = [Platform(300, 500, 200, 20), Platform(100, 400, 200, 20)]

    # Game loop
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                sys.exit()

        # Update player
        player.move()

        # Drawing
        screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen with black
        player.draw(screen)
        for platform in platforms:
            platform.draw(screen)

        pygame.display.flip()  # Update the display
        clock.tick(FPS)  # Maintain the game speed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: Pygame is initialized, and constants for screen width, height, frames per second (FPS), gravity, and jump strength are defined.

2. **Player Class**: The `Player` class handles the player's position, movement, jumping, and drawing the player on the screen. It applies gravity and checks for ground collision to reset the player's position and allow jumping.

3. **Platform Class**: The `Platform` class represents platforms where the player can land. It contains a method to draw itself on the screen.

4. **Main Game Function**: The `main` function sets up the game window, creates instances of the player and platforms, and contains the game loop. The loop processes events, updates the player's position, and renders the game objects.

5. **Game Loop**: The game loop continually checks for events (like quitting), updates the game state, and redraws the screen. It maintains a consistent frame rate using `clock.tick(FPS)`.

This code provides a basic framework for a 2D platformer game using Pygame and can be expanded with more features such as additional platforms, enemies, scoring, and levels.

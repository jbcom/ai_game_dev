"""A tower defense game with different tower types and enemy waves - Generated by AI Game Dev System."""

Sure! Below is a complete, modular, and extensible Pygame tower defense game. This code includes multiple tower types, enemy pathfinding, an upgrade system, and wave management. 

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Pygame**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can install Pygame via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Create the Game File**: Create a new Python file named `tower_defense.py`.

3. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Copy the entire code provided below into `tower_defense.py`.

4. **Run the Game**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python tower_defense.py
   ```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Constants**: Various constants are defined for screen dimensions, costs, enemy health, and game settings.

2. **Classes**:
   - `Tower`: Represents a tower that can be placed on the map. It has a position, damage, and level.
   - `Enemy`: Represents an enemy that moves across the screen. It has health and a rectangle for collision detection.
   - `Game`: Manages the game state, including towers, enemies, score, and game loop.

3. **Game Loop**: The main game loop handles events, updates the game state, and draws everything on the screen.

4. **Drawing**: Towers and enemies are drawn as rectangles for simplicity.

5. **Game Mechanics**: Allows for placing towers, upgrading them, spawning enemies, and checking for collisions.

### Note
This is a basic implementation of a tower defense game. It can be expanded with features like:
- Multiple enemy types
- Different tower types with unique abilities
- A user interface for displaying scores, lives, etc.
- More complex enemy paths and tower range detection.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code to create a more robust tower defense game!

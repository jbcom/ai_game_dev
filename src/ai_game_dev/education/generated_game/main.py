Below is a complete `main.py` file for your game "NeoTokyo Code Academy: The Binary Rebellion" using Pygame. This script sets up the game environment, organizes the main components, and includes comments for clarity. Note that this is a starting point and doesn't include full implementations of all features (like graphics, sound, and detailed interactions), but it provides a solid framework for expansion.

```python
import pygame
import sys
from pygame.locals import QUIT
import json
from random import randint

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("NeoTokyo Code Academy: The Binary Rebellion")
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Define Game Classes
class CharacterClass:
    def __init__(self, name, description, base_stats, abilities, equipment):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.base_stats = base_stats
        self.abilities = abilities
        self.equipment = equipment
        self.level = 1

    def level_up(self):
        # Implement leveling up logic here
        self.level += 1
        # Example stat increase
        self.base_stats['health'] += 10
        self.base_stats['attack'] += 2
        print(f"{self.name} leveled up to {self.level}")

    def use_ability(self, ability_name):
        # Implement ability usage logic here
        if ability_name in self.abilities:
            print(f"{self.name} uses {ability_name}")
        else:
            print(f"Ability {ability_name} not found")

# Load Character Data
def load_characters():
    try:
        with open('characters.json', 'r') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            return [CharacterClass(**char) for char in data]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading character data: {e}")
        return []

characters = load_characters()

# Game Loop
def game_loop():
    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == QUIT:
                running = False

        # Game Logic
        for character in characters:
            # Example: Randomly level up a character
            if randint(0, 100) < 5:
                character.level_up()

        # Drawing
        screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen with black
        # TODO: Add rendering logic for characters and environment

        pygame.display.flip()  # Update the full display surface to the screen
        clock.tick(FPS)  # Maintain 60 FPS

    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()

# Start the Game
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        game_loop()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()
```

### Additional Features and Next Steps:
1. **Data File (`characters.json`):** You will need to create a `characters.json` file with structured data for your character classes, as described in your request.
2. **Graphics and Assets:** Integrate 16-bit pixel art graphics for characters, environments, and UI. Use `pygame.image.load()` to load and display images.
3. **Game Mechanics:** Implement combat, dialogue systems, and other gameplay mechanics. Create separate modules as needed to keep the code organized.
4. **Save System:** Implement a file I/O system to save and load game progress using JSON.
5. **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling across modules for a smooth user experience.
6. **Educational Content:** Integrate educational elements like coding puzzles or challenges that relate to Python programming concepts.

This code provides a strong foundation for your game, with clear areas for further development and enhancement.

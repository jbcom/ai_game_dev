Below is a production-ready `main.py` file for "NeoTokyo Code Academy: The Binary Rebellion", a cyberpunk educational RPG. This file includes Pygame initialization, a game loop, error handling, and imports for game and player modules. Please ensure you have the `pygame` library installed and that the `game` and `player` modules are properly defined in your project.

```python
import pygame
import sys
from game import Game
from player import Player

# Constants
SCREEN_WIDTH = 800
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600
FPS = 60
CYBERPUNK_BLUE = (0, 255, 255)
CYBERPUNK_PURPLE = (255, 0, 255)

def main():
    # Initialize Pygame
    pygame.init()
    
    # Set up the display
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))
    pygame.display.set_caption("NeoTokyo Code Academy: The Binary Rebellion")
    
    # Create a clock object to manage the frame rate
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    
    # Initialize game and player objects
    try:
        game = Game()
        player = Player()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error initializing game or player: {e}")
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()

    # Main game loop
    running = True
    while running:
        # Handle events
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        
        # Game logic
        try:
            game.update()
            player.update()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during game update: {e}")
            running = False

        # Drawing
        screen.fill(CYBERPUNK_BLUE)  # Fill the screen with a cyberpunk blue
        try:
            game.draw(screen)
            player.draw(screen)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during drawing: {e}")
            running = False

        # Update the display
        pygame.display.flip()
        
        # Cap the frame rate
        clock.tick(FPS)
    
    # Clean up and exit
    pygame.quit()
    sys.exit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
        pygame.quit()
        sys.exit()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Pygame Initialization**: The script initializes Pygame and sets up an 800x600 window with a cyberpunk color scheme.

2. **Game Loop**: The main game loop runs at 60 FPS, handling events, updating game logic, and drawing to the screen.

3. **Error Handling**: The script includes try-except blocks to handle errors during initialization, game updates, and drawing. This ensures that the game can shut down gracefully if an error occurs.

4. **Modules**: The script imports `Game` and `Player` from their respective modules. Ensure these modules are defined and contain the necessary logic for your game.

5. **Graceful Shutdown**: The script ensures Pygame is properly quit and the program exits cleanly in case of an error or when the user closes the window.

This `main.py` file serves as the entry point for your educational RPG, setting up the environment and managing the game loop. Make sure to implement the `Game` and `Player` classes in their respective modules to complete the game functionality.

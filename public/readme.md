- **Multiple Engines** - Support for Pygame, Godot, and Bevy
- **Asset Generation** - Automatic creation of sprites, sounds, and music
- **Educational Mode** - Learn programming through gameplay
- **Real-time Updates** - See your game being built step by step

## ðŸŽ¨ Subgraph Architecture

The platform uses specialized subgraphs for different aspects:
- **Graphics Subgraph** - Handles sprite and asset generation
- **Audio Subgraph** - Creates music and sound effects
- **Dialogue Subgraph** - Builds conversation systems
- **Quest Subgraph** - Designs game objectives and progression

Each subgraph operates independently but coordinates through the Chainlit interface for a seamless experience.

1. Be specific in your game descriptions for better results
2. You can specify art style (pixel, cartoon, realistic, cyberpunk)
3. Include gameplay features (combat, puzzles, platforming)
4. The AI will ask for clarification if needed

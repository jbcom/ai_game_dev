# Master Game Specification Example
*This shows how ANY format can be analyzed and converted to complete game content*

## Game Concept
**Title**: "Echoes of the Crystal Nexus"

**Genre**: Action RPG with puzzle elements

**Platform**: PC/Steam, possibly console later

## World & Setting
The world is called **Aethermoor**, a realm where ancient magical crystals have suddenly awakened after centuries of dormancy. These crystals create rifts between dimensions, bringing both dangerous creatures and valuable magical essence into our world.

### Key Locations:
- **Crystalvein Village**: A mining town where dwarves, humans, and elves work together extracting crystal essence
- **The Shattered Peaks**: Mountains riddled with crystal caves and dimensional rifts
- **Ethereal Gardens**: A mystical forest where crystal energy has created sentient plant life

## Core Gameplay
- **Combat**: Real-time action with combo system, dodging, and crystal-powered abilities
- **Exploration**: Metroidvania-style interconnected areas with backtracking as new abilities unlock paths
- **Puzzle Solving**: Crystal manipulation puzzles that affect the environment and open new areas
- **Character Progression**: Skill trees based on different crystal types (Fire, Ice, Shadow, Light, Time)

## Story & Characters

### Main Character
**Kira Stormwind** - A young crystal researcher who discovers she can naturally attune to multiple crystal types (usually people can only use one). She must investigate why the crystals awakened and stop an otherworldly invasion.

### Key NPCs
- **Master Thorgrim Ironbeard**: Dwarven mining foreman, gruff but wise mentor figure
- **Elara Moonwhisper**: Elven crystal artificer, creates magical tools and weapons
- **The Void Touched**: Main antagonist, a being from another dimension using crystal rifts to invade

### Central Conflict
The crystal awakening isn't random - someone is deliberately opening rifts to allow an otherworldly army to invade. Kira must master crystal magic, unite the fractured communities, and discover the truth before the invasion succeeds.

## Visual Style
- **Art Direction**: Hand-painted 2D sprites with detailed pixel art, reminiscent of modern indie metroidvanias
- **Color Palette**: Rich earth tones (browns, deep greens, stone grays) contrasted with vibrant crystal colors (electric blues, fierce reds, mystic purples)
- **Atmosphere**: Dark fantasy with magical elements, mysterious and slightly ominous but not grimdark

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine**: Prefer Bevy (Rust) for performance and modern architecture
- **Target**: 1080p, 60fps, single-player
- **Special Features**: Dynamic lighting from crystals, particle effects for magic, smooth character animations

## Audio & Music
- Orchestral fantasy soundtrack with crystalline/ethereal elements
- Environmental audio that changes near different crystal types
- Voice acting for key story moments

## Scope & Timeline
- **MVP**: Single area (Crystalvein Village) with basic combat, one crystal type, simple quest
- **Full Game**: All 3 main areas, complete story, all 5 crystal types, 15-20 hours gameplay
- **Timeline**: 6-8 months for MVP, 18-24 months for full game
